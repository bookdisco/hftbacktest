# OBI MM Strategy Configuration for Testnet
#
# This configuration is optimized for testnet trading with conservative parameters.
# Adjust values based on your risk tolerance and market conditions.

[global]
# Order size - Binance requires minimum $100 notional per order
# At BTC ~$90,000, this means minimum ~0.0012 BTC
order_qty = 0.002        # ~$180 per order (above $100 minimum)

# Maximum position size (absolute value)
max_position = 0.02      # ~$1800 max position

# Number of orders per side (buy/sell)
grid_num = 3             # 3 orders each side = 6 total orders

# Grid interval in absolute price terms
grid_interval = 1.0      # $1 between grid orders

# Region of Interest bounds (price ticks for order book)

roi_ub = 200000.0

[params]
# Order Book Imbalance parameters
looking_depth = 0.001    # 0.1% depth from mid price for OBI calculation
window = 5               # Z-score normalization window (samples) - SHORT FOR TESTING

# Spread parameters
half_spread = 0.0005     # 0.05% half spread (bid/ask distance from fair price)
skew = 0.01              # Position-based quote skew (higher = more aggressive inventory reduction)
c1 = 0.0001              # Alpha coefficient (OBI impact on fair price)
power = 1.0              # Volatility power (spread multiplier exponent)

# Order management
live_seconds = 30.0      # Cancel orders older than this (seconds)

# Update intervals (nanoseconds)
update_interval_ns = 5000000000      # 5 seconds between strategy updates (FAST FOR TESTING)
volatility_interval_ns = 10000000000 # 10 seconds between volatility updates (FAST FOR TESTING)

[stop_loss]
# Stop loss parameters based on volatility and price change z-scores
# When z-score exceeds threshold, all orders are canceled and position is closed

# NOTE: Using very low thresholds for testing - will trigger frequently!
